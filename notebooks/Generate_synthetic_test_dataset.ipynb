Ms Kite said that an additional problem was the release of documents relating to a previous allegation of child abuse against Mr Jackson. The Smoking Gun website publication was \\\"beyond disaster\\\", Ms Kite said. Correspondents say the reference is important because it was unclear whether the prosecution would be able to bring up the previous case in front of the jury.\\n\\nThe judge is studying whether the prosecution's first witness, reporter Martin Bashir, is in contempt of court. The defence protested after Mr Bashir, who interviewed Jackson for the TV documentary, refused to answer nearly all their questions, citing a California \\\"shield\\\" law intended to allow journalists to protect their sources. In the prosecution's opening statement on Monday, Tom Sneddon told the court that Mr Jackson had shown the boy porn and plied him with wine, in order to molest him. He said the singer had visited sexually explicit websites and showed the boy - who was 13 at the time - and his younger brother pornography at his ranch.\",\n          \"Dame Julie pops in to see Poppins\\n\\nMary Poppins star Dame Julie Andrews watched the hit stage version of her classic film at a charity performance in London's West End.\\n\\nIt was the first time Dame Julie, who shot to fame as the nanny in the 1964 Disney movie, had seen the musical, staged at the Prince Edward Theatre. She watched Laura Michelle Kelly, 23, reprise the role on stage. The show has been one of the West End's hottest tickets since opening in December, winning two Olivier Awards. Kelly was named best musical actress at last month's ceremony and the musical also won best choreography.\\n\\nBut Kelly said she was \\\"very nervous\\\" about meeting Dame Julie because she was \\\"my absolute hero\\\". The gala performance saw Dame Julie, 69, return to the theatre where she had her first starring role in a performance of Humpty Dumpty in 1948. The Mary Poppins musical has been masterminded by theatre impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh and directed by Richard Eyre with choreography by Matthew Bourne. Sir Cameron said he hoped the production, which cost \\u00a39m to bring to the stage, was a blend of the sweet-natured film and the original book by PL Travers. Proceeds from Thursday's show will go to charities including Absolute Return for Kids (Ark), international relief agency Operation USA and drama school Lamda.\",\n          \"Newcastle 2-1 Bolton\\n\\nKieron Dyer smashed home the winner to end Bolton's 10-game unbeaten run.\\n\\nLee Bowyer put Newcastle ahead when he fed Stephen Carr on the right flank, then sprinted into the area to power home a header from the resultant cross. Wanderers hit back through Stelios Giannakopoulos, who ended a fluid passing move with a well-struck volley. But Dyer had the last word in a game of few chances, pouncing on a loose ball after Alan Shearer's shot was blocked and firing into the top corner. Neither side lacked urgency in the early stages of the game, with plenty of tackles flying in, but opportunities in front of goal were harder to come by. Bolton keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen had to make two saves in quick succession midway through the first-half - keeping out Shearer's low shot and Dyer's close-range header - but that was the only goalmouth action of note. And it was almost out of nothing that the Magpies took the lead on 35 minutes. Bowyer found space with a neat turn on the half-way line and striding forward picked out Carr to his right. He then continued his run and with perfect timing made his way into the box where he met Carr's cross with a downward header into the far corner. Bolton had produced little going forward at this point but they responded well.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 299,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"What is Halifax's prediction for house prices in 2005?\",\n          \"How many Olivier Awards did the Mary Poppins musical win?\",\n          \"What is iPodder?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 298,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Dick Morris believes that bureaucratism is the greatest threat to democracy in the world.\",\n          \"One of New Labour's greatest successes before the historic 1997 election was persuading voters, business, and the City that it could be trusted to run the economy.\",\n          \"Between 3% and 5%.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"entertainment\",\n          \"business\",\n          \"tech\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Ms Kite said that an additional problem was the release of documents relating to a previous allegation of child abuse against Mr Jackson. The Smoking Gun website publication was \\\"beyond disaster\\\", Ms Kite said. Correspondents say the reference is important because it was unclear whether the prosecution would be able to bring up the previous case in front of the jury.\\n\\nThe judge is studying whether the prosecution's first witness, reporter Martin Bashir, is in contempt of court. The defence protested after Mr Bashir, who interviewed Jackson for the TV documentary, refused to answer nearly all their questions, citing a California \\\"shield\\\" law intended to allow journalists to protect their sources. In the prosecution's opening statement on Monday, Tom Sneddon told the court that Mr Jackson had shown the boy porn and plied him with wine, in order to molest him. He said the singer had visited sexually explicit websites and showed the boy - who was 13 at the time - and his younger brother pornography at his ranch.\",\n          \"Dame Julie pops in to see Poppins\\n\\nMary Poppins star Dame Julie Andrews watched the hit stage version of her classic film at a charity performance in London's West End.\\n\\nIt was the first time Dame Julie, who shot to fame as the nanny in the 1964 Disney movie, had seen the musical, staged at the Prince Edward Theatre. She watched Laura Michelle Kelly, 23, reprise the role on stage. The show has been one of the West End's hottest tickets since opening in December, winning two Olivier Awards. Kelly was named best musical actress at last month's ceremony and the musical also won best choreography.\\n\\nBut Kelly said she was \\\"very nervous\\\" about meeting Dame Julie because she was \\\"my absolute hero\\\". The gala performance saw Dame Julie, 69, return to the theatre where she had her first starring role in a performance of Humpty Dumpty in 1948. The Mary Poppins musical has been masterminded by theatre impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh and directed by Richard Eyre with choreography by Matthew Bourne. Sir Cameron said he hoped the production, which cost \\u00a39m to bring to the stage, was a blend of the sweet-natured film and the original book by PL Travers. Proceeds from Thursday's show will go to charities including Absolute Return for Kids (Ark), international relief agency Operation USA and drama school Lamda.\",\n          \"Newcastle 2-1 Bolton\\n\\nKieron Dyer smashed home the winner to end Bolton's 10-game unbeaten run.\\n\\nLee Bowyer put Newcastle ahead when he fed Stephen Carr on the right flank, then sprinted into the area to power home a header from the resultant cross. Wanderers hit back through Stelios Giannakopoulos, who ended a fluid passing move with a well-struck volley. But Dyer had the last word in a game of few chances, pouncing on a loose ball after Alan Shearer's shot was blocked and firing into the top corner. Neither side lacked urgency in the early stages of the game, with plenty of tackles flying in, but opportunities in front of goal were harder to come by. Bolton keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen had to make two saves in quick succession midway through the first-half - keeping out Shearer's low shot and Dyer's close-range header - but that was the only goalmouth action of note. And it was almost out of nothing that the Magpies took the lead on 35 minutes. Bowyer found space with a neat turn on the half-way line and striding forward picked out Carr to his right. He then continued his run and with perfect timing made his way into the box where he met Carr's cross with a downward header into the far corner. Bolton had produced little going forward at this point but they responded well.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 299,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"What is Halifax's prediction for house prices in 2005?\",\n          \"How many Olivier Awards did the Mary Poppins musical win?\",\n          \"What is iPodder?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 298,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Dick Morris believes that bureaucratism is the greatest threat to democracy in the world.\",\n          \"One of New Labour's greatest successes before the historic 1997 election was persuading voters, business, and the City that it could be trusted to run the economy.\",\n          \"Between 3% and 5%.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"entertainment\",\n          \"business\",\n          \"tech\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"groundedness_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"5\",\n          \"3\",\n          \"4\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"groundedness_eval\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 300,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The context clearly states that Ms. Kite described the Smoking Gun website publication as 'beyond disaster'.

Ms Kite said that an additional problem was the release of documents relating to a previous allegation of child abuse against Mr Jackson. The Smoking Gun website publication was \\\"beyond disaster\\\", Ms Kite said. Correspondents say the reference is important because it was unclear whether the prosecution would be able to bring up the previous case in front of the jury.\\n\\nThe judge is studying whether the prosecution's first witness, reporter Martin Bashir, is in contempt of court. The defence protested after Mr Bashir, who interviewed Jackson for the TV documentary, refused to answer nearly all their questions, citing a California \\\"shield\\\" law intended to allow journalists to protect their sources. In the prosecution's opening statement on Monday, Tom Sneddon told the court that Mr Jackson had shown the boy porn and plied him with wine, in order to molest him. He said the singer had visited sexually explicit websites and showed the boy - who was 13 at the time - and his younger brother pornography at his ranch.\",\n          \"Dame Julie pops in to see Poppins\\n\\nMary Poppins star Dame Julie Andrews watched the hit stage version of her classic film at a charity performance in London's West End.\\n\\nIt was the first time Dame Julie, who shot to fame as the nanny in the 1964 Disney movie, had seen the musical, staged at the Prince Edward Theatre. She watched Laura Michelle Kelly, 23, reprise the role on stage. The show has been one of the West End's hottest tickets since opening in December, winning two Olivier Awards. Kelly was named best musical actress at last month's ceremony and the musical also won best choreography.\\n\\nBut Kelly said she was \\\"very nervous\\\" about meeting Dame Julie because she was \\\"my absolute hero\\\". The gala performance saw Dame Julie, 69, return to the theatre where she had her first starring role in a performance of Humpty Dumpty in 1948. The Mary Poppins musical has been masterminded by theatre impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh and directed by Richard Eyre with choreography by Matthew Bourne. Sir Cameron said he hoped the production, which cost \\u00a39m to bring to the stage, was a blend of the sweet-natured film and the original book by PL Travers. Proceeds from Thursday's show will go to charities including Absolute Return for Kids (Ark), international relief agency Operation USA and drama school Lamda.\",\n          \"Newcastle 2-1 Bolton\\n\\nKieron Dyer smashed home the winner to end Bolton's 10-game unbeaten run.\\n\\nLee Bowyer put Newcastle ahead when he fed Stephen Carr on the right flank, then sprinted into the area to power home a header from the resultant cross. Wanderers hit back through Stelios Giannakopoulos, who ended a fluid passing move with a well-struck volley. But Dyer had the last word in a game of few chances, pouncing on a loose ball after Alan Shearer's shot was blocked and firing into the top corner. Neither side lacked urgency in the early stages of the game, with plenty of tackles flying in, but opportunities in front of goal were harder to come by. Bolton keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen had to make two saves in quick succession midway through the first-half - keeping out Shearer's low shot and Dyer's close-range header - but that was the only goalmouth action of note. And it was almost out of nothing that the Magpies took the lead on 35 minutes. Bowyer found space with a neat turn on the half-way line and striding forward picked out Carr to his right. He then continued his run and with perfect timing made his way into the box where he met Carr's cross with a downward header into the far corner. Bolton had produced little going forward at this point but they responded well.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 299,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"What is Halifax's prediction for house prices in 2005?\",\n          \"How many Olivier Awards did the Mary Poppins musical win?\",\n          \"What is iPodder?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 298,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Dick Morris believes that bureaucratism is the greatest threat to democracy in the world.\",\n          \"One of New Labour's greatest successes before the historic 1997 election was persuading voters, business, and the City that it could be trusted to run the economy.\",\n          \"Between 3% and 5%.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"entertainment\",\n          \"business\",\n          \"tech\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"groundedness_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"5\",\n          \"3\",\n          \"4\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"groundedness_eval\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 300,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The context clearly states that Ms. Kite described the Smoking Gun website publication as 'beyond disaster'.

Mr Yushchenko\\'s administration has accused its predecessor, led by ex-President Leonid Kuchma, of corruption. The privatisation review\\'s number one target is a steel mill sold to a consortium which included Viktor Pinchuk, Mr Kuchma\\'s son-in-law, for $800m (£424m) despite higher bids from several foreign groups. The mill, Krivorizhstal, is one of the world\\'s most profitable. \"We say Krivorizhstal was stolen, and at any cost we will return it to the state,\" Mr Yushchenko told an investors\\' conference in Kiev.\\n\\nOne of the jilted bidders, Netherlands-based group LNM, said it welcomed the possibility that the mill might be back on the market.\\n\\n\"If the original privatisation is annulled and a new tender issued, then we would look at it with great interest,\" a spokesman told BBC News. A resale of Krivorizhstal could potentially triple the price, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit\\'s Mr Hensel. But he warned that the government could decide to take the easy route of revaluing the company and charging the existing owners the revised price rather than undertaking a fresh sale. \"That way, Mr Yushchenko can go to the public and say he has forced the oligarchs to play by the rules,\" he told BBC News.'"

But not everyone was as supportive. Florian Mueller, campaign manager of a group lobbying toprevent software patents becoming legal in the European Union,dismissed IBM's move as insubstantial. \\\"It's just diversionary tactics,\\\" wrote Mr Mueller, who leadsnosoftwarepatents.com, in a message on the group's website. \\\"Let's put this into perspective: We're talking aboutroughly one percent of IBM's worldwide patent portfolio. They filethat number of patents in about a month's time,\\\" he added. IBM will continue to hold the 500 patents but it has pledged to seek no royalties from the patents.

It took $19.1m (\\u00a39.9m) on Christmas Day alone, the highest takings on that day in box office history. The sequel to the Ben Stiller comedy Meet The Parents stars Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. The success of Meet the Fockers could help produce record box office revenue for 2004, said Paul Dergarabedian, president of the industry's tracker Exhibitor Relations. \\\"We've had a much stronger than anticipated final week of the year that helped the industry end on a high note,\\\" said Mr Dergarabedian.\\n\\nMeet the Fockers also broke the box office records for the most money taken on New Year's Eve, when it made $12.2m (\\u00a36.2m), and New Year's Day, when it took $18m (\\u00a39.4m). The previous New Year's Eve record was set in 2000 by Cast Away with $8.5m (\\u00a34.5m). The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King had held the New Year's Day title with $12.8m (\\u00a36.7m). However, Christmas takings were down 26.5% on 2003's figures - which was blamed on Christmas falling over a weekend this year. This weekend's top 12 films took an estimated $125.4m (\\u00a365.8m), a 4.3% increase on the same weekend last year. But there were no major releases last week to provide competition to Meet the Fockers or Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, which finished in second place with $14.7m (\\u00a37.7m). The Aviator, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes, ended up in third position after taking $11.2m (\\u00a35.9m). Comedy Fat Albert - co-written by Bill Cosby - moved down the chart to fourth place after taking $10.7m (\\u00a35.6m).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 268,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"What was Germany's economic growth last year?\",\n          \"What was the purpose of the 2002 Iraq weapons dossier?\",\n          \"What do serious players do before an attack?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 268,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1.6%\",\n          \"The purpose of the dossier was to persuade the British why the government thought Iraq was a very serious threat.\",\n          \"Serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e-mail.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"entertainment\",\n          \"business\",\n          \"tech\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"groundedness_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 5,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"groundedness_eval\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 269,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The context lists Sylvain Marconnet as playing for Stade Francais.

In such attacks thousands of computers bombard sites with data in an attempt to overwhelm them. Laws in many countries do not explicitly outlaw such attacks but many nations are re-drafting computer use laws to make them specific offences. Lycos Europe now appears to have put the plan on hold. The site hosting the screensaver currently shows a holding page, with the words, \"Stay tuned\". The numerical internet address of the site has also changed. This is likely to be in response to spammers who have reportedly redirected traffic from their sites back to the Lycos screensaver site. The campaign has come under fire from some corners of the web. Many discussion groups have said that it set a dangerous precedent and could incite vigilantism. \"Attacking a spammer\\'s website is like poking a grizzly bear sleeping in your back garden with a pointy stick,\" said Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant for Sophos. \"Not only is this screensaver similar in its approach to a potentially illegal distributed denial of service attack, but it also is in danger of turning innocent computer users into vigilantes, who may not be prepared for whatever retaliation the spammers care to dream up.\"'"
